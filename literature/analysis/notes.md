  - Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA)
    - analyze influence of multiple tree species in one pixel
    - useful for low resolution data
    - rather feature extraction than analysis
  - Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA)
    - segmentation of the image to produce homogeneous regions
    - these image objects are then used as the classification unit
    - useful for high resolution data
    - also rather feature extraction
  - Hierarchical mapping System:
    - step-wise classification, e.g. first vegetated/non-vegetated, then grass/lawn/tree, then shadow/sunlit, then final classification
  - Classification methods:
    - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
    - Classification and Regression Trees (CART)    
    - Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC)
    - Spectral Matching (SM) with Spectral Angel Mapper (SAM)
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Remote Sensing of Environment (local)
  - literature review on the field from 2016
  - gives table of commonly used classification models (page 77)
  - "The choice of the classifier itself is often of low importance if the data is adequately pre-processed to match the requirements of the classifier."
