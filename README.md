# :deciduous_tree: :deciduous_tree: Hyperspectral Tree Analysis :deciduous_tree: :deciduous_tree:
A scientific team project of students at the Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Factory Operation and Automation IFF

## Goal
Referring to current projects for the airborne acquisition and analysis of hyperspectral data concerning tree species classification and vitality estimation, we want to develop new approaches for analysis based on current methods in machine learning.

## Data
The Fraunhofer IFF will provide appropriate hyperspectral data sets.

## Tasks
1. Implementation of an evaluation framework
2. Extraction of an appropriate feature space
3. Analysis using machine learning / pattern recognition methods
4. Integration and execution of tests
5. Documentation
