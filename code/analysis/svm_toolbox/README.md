SVM Toolbox is a set of Matlab functions that provide access to basic SVM functionalities such as linear and non-linear separation of data points in an arbitrarily dimensional room. It was developed during a project within the lecture “Machine Learning: Statistical Approaches 2”, held by Prof. Bernt Schiele in winter term 2009 at Darmstadt University of Technology, Department of Computer Science.
